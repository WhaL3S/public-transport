# public-transport
This program was created in Visual Studio 2019 and written in C#. The firs of all purpose of this project is to get acquainted with List in C# as a part of the OOP course. I used GUI, so actually, if you download the whole file and run the .sln file (solution), you will be able to see how it generally works. Everything is described in each classes, so you can use it as a tutorial or any way you wish to. There is no big meaning of the program, just investigate what every method can do and how they works. Before using this implemented List, I was manually creating Container class with all necessary methods written inside of it, and in comparison, the use of List is really fast and convenient, however, I would recommend to try to copy all methods of List by yourself just to understand how it precisely works.
